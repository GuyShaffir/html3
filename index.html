<P>
The German name for Austria.<br> Österreich, derives from the Old High German Ostarrîchi, which meant "eastern realm" and which first appeared in the "Ostarrîchi document" of 996.<br>[17][18] This word is probably a translation of Medieval Latin Marchia orientalis into a local (Bavarian) dialect.
</P>
Austria, officially the Republic of Austria, is a landlocked country in the southern part of Central Europe, situated at Eastern Alps.
<P>
The Central European land that is now Austria we <br>settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes.

On 21 October 1918, the elected German members of the Reichsrat (parliament of Imperial Austria) met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for German Austria (Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich)<br> On 30 October the assembly founded the Republic of German Austria by appointing a government, called Staatsrat.<hr> This new government was invited by the Emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy, but refrained from this business.[45]

Vienna has an extensive transportation network with a unified fare system that integrates municipal, regional and railway systems under the umbrella of the Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region (VOR). <b>Public transport is provided by buses, trams and five underground metro lines (U-Bahn), most operated by the Wiener Linien.
</P>
Vienna is served by Vienna International Airport, located 18 km (11 mi) southeast of the city center next to the town of Schwechat. The airport handled approximately 31.7 million passengers in 2019.[149] Following lengthy negotiations with surrounding communities, the airport will be expanded to increase its capacity by adding a third runway. <b>The airport is undergoing a major expansion, including a new terminal building that opened in 2012 to prepare for an increase in passengers.
