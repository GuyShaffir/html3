		 Stamina
Sports c<ar racing is closed, circular and paved track racing for sports cars.There are categories for serial models and prototypes that are sometimes single-seat based but still have a covered wheel (as opposed to an exposed wheel in some formula races). In this category, individual but prolonged races known as endurance racing are accepted. Endurance races are held that are limited to a certain period of time (e.g. 24 hours) or any distance (e.g. the 12 Hours of Sebring).
       
		 </li>
		 Carting
Kart races are held on relatively small, paved and small circuits (sometimes even in parking lots). <br>The length of the race vehicles is about one and a half meters and their width is about one meter. <br>They are equipped with small engines of up to 200 cc and sometimes even without a gearbox. The maximum speeds are usually up to only about 150 km/h, but the densely turned, turning route puts high side forces on the driver using the salix tires (a tire without grooves) that provide high road traction. Karting racing is sometimes used by young drivers and even children who are taking their first steps in the motor world.

Dedicated Fanny Car
Drag racing is a race that takes place in a straight line for a short distance, usually 400 meters. <br>The competition is always between two vehicles competing side by side. <br>The winner advances to the next level. The participating cars range from serial models to mission-oriented cars. The dedicated cars have an unusual appearance of ferris wheels on the rear axle and a tiny wheel on the front axis.
